# Research-Reader
Research Reader is a free &amp; open-source TTS application designed to help students with learning disabilities like ADHD focus on their research.

Far too many free-to-use TTS applications only provide distracting, hard to understand, low quality voices that aren't suitable for sustained periods of research, and this project aims to change that.
